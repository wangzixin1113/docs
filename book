book:

    the book that impressed me is the song of ice and fire, yet, actually It is an series.
    the author has bult a magic, fantacy world. and a lot of charcter is here.
    the most I liked is the imp. He is born  as a dwalf, but he is quite wise, clever, and he is 
    just, he want to make a better world. and he is quite gilted in handling some political 
    stuffs. Through his effort, in the season 6, the imp came to the mother of dragon, and
    served as her adviser. What I want to say, is the book, or the imp teach me, is we
    can not choose how we born, as normal, genius or dwalf, what we can is try to make it ou
    go on fighting, keep learning, and by that we will succeed.
